# Build a Full End-to-End Web Application


## TL;DR
Build a Math Power web application. Use Amplify to create and host a webpage and also using Lambda to do the calculation alongside a API Gateway to be able to invoke the math functionality. I used DynamoDB to store and return the math result with IAM to handle permission. 

## The Power of the Math 
A simple Maths calculation. The user would access the website and would be introduce a simple tool where they can pick what number that they would want to be calculated and generate the result. 

The App consists of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

OTHER SERVICES:
-  Text Editor


## The Deployment Environment
The code will be deployed and hosted in Amplify.
